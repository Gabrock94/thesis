\begin{abstract}

Approximate computing trades off accuracy for efficiency
in a wide variety of modern applications, from mobile vision to
data analytics.
Unlike traditional optimizations, approximation techniques exploit deep
application-specific properties:
they require a combination of compiler automation and programmer guidance.
We describe \sysname, an open-source framework for approximation
that balances tool support with programmer insight and control.
It includes C/C++ language extensions for conveying programmer intent,
a compiler analysis library that identifies
safely approximatable code, an autotuning system that automatically chooses the best
approximation strategies, and a feedback mechanism that explains
how annotations can be improved for better approximation opportunities.
\sysname automatically applies a variety of approximation
techniques, including hardware
acceleration, while ensuring their safety.
We apply \sysname to nine workloads on a standard desktop, an
FPGA-augmented mobile SoC, and an energy-harvesting sensor device
to evaluate the annotation process.
We observe average speedups of \result{speedup-x86-mean},
\result{speedup-zynq-mean},
and \result{speedup-msp430-mean} on the three platforms, respectively.
