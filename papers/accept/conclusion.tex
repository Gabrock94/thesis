\section{Conclusion}

For approximate computing to be successful,
programmers need better tools for program relaxation that are safer than
manual reasoning but more practical than opaque automatic transformation.
\sysname is a compiler framework for approximate programming that
balances automation with programmer insight.
It supports a wide range of approximate code transformations, including
both pure-software relaxations and offloading to hardware accelerators.
This paper demonstrates that \sysname can yield substantial
end-to-end performance benefits with little quality degradation.

Approximate computing research is in its infancy and needs more tools for
prototyping and evaluating ideas.
The \sysname framework can simplify the implementation and evaluation of new
ideas in approximate computing, from superoptimization to hardware accelerator
design.
We hope to support \sysname as common, open-source infrastructure for
approximate computing research.
