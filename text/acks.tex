The acknowledgments go here.

This dissertation describes work done by a staggering array of amazing
researchers who are not me.
Most significantly, DECAF in Chapter~\ref{ch:decaf} is Brett Boston's research
project for the honors designation on his bachelor's degree.
He did all the hard work; I played the role of a meddling mentor.
