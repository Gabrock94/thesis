Computer systems spend time, energy, and complexity to provide error-free
program execution. But
perfect precision is wasted on many kinds of programs. For applications from
domains like graphics, vision, machine learning, and games, perfect precision
is infeasible or even unattainable. \emph{Approximate computing} techniques exploit
these programs' resilience to make them more efficient.

Approximate systems hold potential, but they also pose new
risks.
To safely and efficiently exploit accuracy--efficiency trade-offs, we need
new abstractions that coordinate every layer of the system stack:
programming languages,
CPU and accelerator architectures, storage systems, compilers, and
property checking.
